# README.md

This is a fun project I made, when I couldn't find a color generator to suit my needs (and was bored)

# Run Using

Run using

`python3 main.py`

If there is an error make sure Pygame is installed \
this can be done by running 

`pip3 install pygame`


# License

Copy this whenever, wherever, say it's your own code for all I care.
I just made this to solve a problem I had.
